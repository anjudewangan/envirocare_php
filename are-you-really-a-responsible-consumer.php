                            <p><b>Introduction</b></p>
                            <p>Fast fashion brands entail mass-market retailers who create products in large quantities in response to the latest trends (Oxford University Press, n.d.). Fast fashion brands waste over 92 million tonnes of waste and consume 79 trillion liters of water per year (Niinimäki et al. 2020). However, the environmental price they impose is often not thought out by us when we buy from such stores; especially, because psychological science shows how we feel a sense of short-lived pleasure known as the “dopamine response” after consuming fast fashion branded products.</p>
                            <p> So, the task for you is to go on a Google search, and find out the latest fast fashion brands; subsequently, ask yourself, “Am I a responsible consumer?” If the answer is no, read this article to find out how to not be a victim of fast fashion brands by understanding the science behind their influence on you!</p>

                            <p><b>Aim of the article</b></p>
                            <p>This article aims to assess socio-economic factors and their underlying psychological bases through concepts such as decision-making, motivation, and thinking, among others. Through this, the article adopts an interdisciplinary approach to understanding how fast fashion brand consumption is driven. Thus, acknowledging how such factors can help us introduce innovative solutions for a more sustainable future.</p>

                            <p><b>The science of fast fashion consumption</b></p>
                            <p>Psychological science has helped us understand how we, as humans, are biologically and cognitively impacted by fast fashion brands.</p>
                            <p>When we look at an item from a fast fashion brand, we tend to think to ourselves, “Wow! So cheap and looks good? It’s a win-win.” However, such low prices and convenience are disguises to the greenhouse gas emissions of such products. The human body secretes Dopamine or the “reward hormone” in the pursuit of inexpensive things. Such instant gratification from fast fashion brands coupled with short-lived pleasure drive us to become victims of fast fashion brands (Hartston, 2012). You know what? This is their exact strategy: to provide clothes at cheap and expensive prices, because they know of this scientific fact. So, let’s start using this as a catalyst for boycotting fast fashion brands, rather than one that such brands use to trick us!</p>
                            <p>The drive for humans to seek conformity explains why we support fast fashion brands. Humans strive to seek conformity in social settings. Fitting into the crowd and doing what everyone else is doing, also known as “following trends”, is personally significant to humans, to feel a sense of belonging and community. Hence, when the latest trends are followed by fast fashion brands, we can’t resist the urge to hop on the bandwagon.</p>
                            <p>Moreover, fast fashion brands understand that hedonic consumption (when consumers derive pleasure from purchases) is often done without reflection or consideration of the socio-economic repercussions of an item, as opposed to utilitarian purchases (which consider such impacts). Hence, consumers feel this “high” and tend to overspend on such brands, due to a dopamine response .</p>

                            <p><b>Reclaiming consumer responsibility: prevention techniques</b></p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Spread awareness to friends and family members: it is imperative that we, after becoming knowledgeable about such things, inform others around us about the same; this way, we learn and grow together. Hence, helping us understand our shared guardianship over the planet.</li>

                                <li>Initiate social media campaigns: this goes without saying; the key to an effective climate-changing society is always action and communication: both aspects which campaigns help us embrace.</li>

                                <li>Change your perspective: shift the way you view fashion; instead of thinking “quick and cheap”, think “responsible and ethical”; instead of thinking, “Should I repeat this outfit?”, think, “The environment needs me.” After all, becoming responsible citizens requires a thorough re-evaluation of our relationship with the natural world.</li>

                                <li>Research: while billboards of fast fashion brands are ubiquitous, we must research ethical and eco-friendly fashion companies which are emerging. Heads up: you will find many blog articles about this topic!</li>

                                <li>Be realistic: The last strategy is to do well…be realistic. After all, we must understand that change occurs over periods, not overnight. Thus, we all should know that the switch to ethical brands will not occur overnight, but through a journey. Start small. Maybe buy a T-shirt from a sustainable fashion brand for one week. Then the next week, buy trousers. Know that this takes time and that is OKAY.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            <p><b>Conclusion</b></p>
                            <blockquote class="alime-blockquote">
                                <h4>Fast fashion brands are exploiting the weaknesses that lay within your desires and emotions to yield profit and rise to the top.</br> <b>“Stop being a supporter; be a denouncer instead”,</b> is the best strategy that we, at Envirocare Foundation, advocate for. Once we begin to educate and spread awareness to others about the detrimental impacts of the not-so-glorious “Fast-fashion” brands, we shall experience true environmental transformation: one that helps us meet the needs of today without comprising the needs of future citizens. Let us be global citizens and heal our relationship with the environment, one step at a time.</h4>
