                            <p><b>Introduction </b></p>
                            <p>When we talk about net zero energy consumption, we're referring to the idea that your home should operate like a "free" one. You'll save money by not paying for electricity or gas. In addition to this, you'll also be doing your part for the environment by reducing your carbon footprint and being carbon neutral.</p>
                            <p><b>Reduce carbon footprint</b></p>
                            <p>Reducing your carbon footprint is an important part of reducing your energy consumption. The more you can do to reduce the amount of energy you use, the fewer impacts companies and industries have on global warming and climate change.</p>
                            <p>In addition to reducing waste, it's also important to use renewable energy sources such as solar or wind power when possible so that you're not contributing environmentally harmful greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.</p>
                            <p>If you’re looking to reduce your carbon footprint, there are many things you can do. The first step is to analyze your current energy consumption by using an energy audit of your building. (Could use our Carbon Book app) This will identify the amount of energy being used and measure it.</p>

                            <p><b>Carbon neutral</b></p>
                            <p>Carbon neutral means that you are not adding to the carbon emissions of the world, but rather offsetting your own. You can do this by planting trees or using a certain amount of renewable energy in your home. The idea behind offsetting is that when you use less energy, it's easier for industries/companies to reduce their footprint on climate change by switching from fossil fuels back to renewable sources.</p>
                            <p>The idea of carbon neutrality has been gaining popularity over recent years because many people feel more comfortable knowing how much impact they have had on their environment as opposed to simply thinking about how much money is being made off them at any given time.</p>
                            <p><b>Net Zero is good for the environment</b></p>
                            <p>Put simply, net zero means cutting greenhouse gas emissions to as close to zero as possible, with any remaining emissions re-absorbed from the atmosphere, by oceans and forests for instance. “The mission is that emissions need to be reduced by 45% by 2030 and reach net zero by 2050”- United Nations</p>
                            <p>It reduces carbon footprint. A Net Zero home uses renewable energy sources like solar panels, geothermal heat pumps, and wind turbines to offset its electricity use by producing enough energy on-site to power all of its appliances and electronics as well as charge electric cars or run other green technology.</p>
                            <p>Think about it like a bath – turn on the taps and you add more water, pull out the plug and water flows out. The amount of water in the bath depends on both the input from the taps and the output via the plughole. To keep the amount of water in the bath at the same level, you need to make sure that the input and output are balanced.</p>
                            <p>Reaching net zero applies the same principle, requiring us to balance the number of greenhouse gases we emit with the amount we remove. When what we add is no more than what we take away, we reach net zero.</p>
                            <p><b>Conclusion</b></p>
                            <blockquote class="alime-blockquote">
                                <h4>As mentioned before, there are many ways you can go about reducing your carbon footprint. One of them is by going zero waste. This means that you should try to avoid buying anything with packaging or plastic packaging as much as possible. Another way to help the environment is by adopting renewable energy sources which produce no negative emissions.</h4>
